\subsection{Description}

\noindent Consider the following relation:

\[ laptops : Model \leftrightarrow Brand \]

\noindent where

\[
laptops = \\
\hspace{5mm} \{ \\
\hspace{10mm} legion5 \mapsto lenovo,\\
\hspace{10mm} macbookair \mapsto apple,\\
\hspace{10mm} xps15 \mapsto dell,\\
\hspace{10mm} spectre \mapsto hp,\\
\hspace{10mm} xps13 \mapsto dell,\\
\hspace{10mm} swift3 \mapsto acer,\\
\hspace{10mm} macbookpro \mapsto apple,\\
\hspace{10mm} dragonfly \mapsto hp,\\
\hspace{10mm} envyx360 \mapsto hp\\
\hspace{5mm} \}
\]

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the domain and the range of the relation?\\

\item What is the result of the expression

\[ \{ xps15, xps13, swift3, envyx360 \}  \lhd laptops \]

\noindent What is the meaning of perator $\lhd$ and where would you deploy such operator in the context of a database management system?

\item What is the result of the expression

\[ laptops \rhd \{ lenovo, hp \} \]

\noindent What is the meaning of operator $\rhd$ and where would you deploy such operator in the context of a database management system?

\item What is the result of the expression

\[ \{ legion5, xps15, xps13, dragonfly \} \ndres laptops \]

\noindent What is the meaning of operator $\ndres$ and where would you deploy such operator in the context of a database management system?

\item What is the result of the expression

\[ laptops \nrres \{ apple, dell, hp \} \]

\noindent What is the meaning of operator $\nrres$ and where would you deploy such operator in the context of a database management system?

\item Consider the following expression

\[ laptop \oplus \{ ideapad \mapsto lenovo \} \]

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the result of the expression?

\item What is the meaning of operator $\oplus$ and where would you deploy such operator in the context of a database management system?

\item Does the result of the expression have a permanent effect on the database (relation)? If not, describe in detail how would you ensure a permanent effect. 

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
