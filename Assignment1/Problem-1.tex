\section{Problem 1 (8 pts)}
\subsection{Problem:}

\noindent You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a \textbf{number} on one side and a \textbf{symbol} on the other side. The visible faces of the cards show the numbers \textbf{2} and \textbf{7}, and the symbols \textbf{$\Box$}, and \textbf{$\bigcirc$}.\\

\noindent Which card(s) must you turn over in order to test the truth of the proposition that \textit{``If a card has an odd number on one side, then it has the symbol $\Box$ on the other side''}? Explain your reasoning by deciding for \underline{each} card whether it should be turned over and why.\\

\subsection{Answer:}

The first card's visible face shows the number 2. The statement reads: \textit{``If a card has an odd number on one side, then it has the symbol $\Box$ on the other side''}. Since 2 is not an odd number, whatever symbol is behind that card will not affect the truth of the proposition. Therefore, it does not need to be turned over.\\ \\
The second card's visible face shows the number 7. Since this is an odd number, to test the truth value of the stated proposition, this card has to be turned over to check if it has a square symbol on the back. \\ \\
The third card's visible face shows the square symbol. In order to test the truth value of the stated proposition, this needs to be turned over in order to check if it has an odd number on the back side. \\ \\ 
The fourth card's visible face shows the circle symbol. Since the circle symbol is not an square symbol, whatever number (odd or even) is behind that card will not affect the truth of the proposition. Therefore, it does not need to be turned over.
