\subsection{Problem:}

\noindent You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a \textbf{number} on one side and a \textbf{symbol} on the other side. The visible faces of the cards show the numbers \textbf{2} and \textbf{7}, and the symbols \textbf{$\Box$}, and \textbf{$\bigcirc$}.\\

\noindent Which card(s) must you turn over in order to test the truth of the proposition that \textit{``If a card has an odd number on one side, then it has the symbol $\Box$ on the other side''}? Explain your reasoning by deciding for \underline{each} card whether it should be turned over and why.\\
