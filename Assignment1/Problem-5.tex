\underline{Relation R}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflexive:  Since (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) (3,3), (4,4) $\in R$, it is reflexive.
    \item Irreflexive: Not irreflexive since an element that is related to itself exists (i.e (0,0)).
    \item Symmetric: Not symmetric since (3,1) $\in R$, but (1,3) $\notin R$.
    \item Asymmetric: Not asymmetric since (0,1), (1,0) $\in R$.
    \item Antisymmetric: Not antisymmetric since (0,1), (1,0) $\in R$, but 0 $\neq$ 1.
    \item Transitive: Not transitive since (1,0), (0,3) $\in R$, but (1,3) $\notin R$. 
    \item Equivalence: Not an equivalence relation since it is not reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
    \item Partial order: Not a partial order relation since it is not reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
\end{itemize}


\underline{Relation S}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflexive: Not reflexive since (0,0) $\notin S$.
    \item Irreflexive: Not irreflexive since (1,1) $\in S$.
    \item Symmetric: Not symmetric since (0,1) $\in S$, but (1,0) $\notin S$.
    \item Asymmetric: Not asymmetric since (1,1) $\in S$, which is a self-loop.
    \item Antisymmetric: Since every element in $S$ is not bidirectional except for self-loops, it is antisymmetric.
    \item Transitive: Not transitive since (2,3), (3,0) $\in S$, but (2,0) $\notin S$.
    \item Equivalence: Not an equivalence relation since it is not reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
    \item Partial order: Not a partial order relation since it is not reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
\end{itemize}

\underline{Relation T}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflexive: Not reflexive since (0,0) $\notin S$.
    \item Irreflexive: Since no element that is related to itself belongs to $T$, it is irreflexive.
    \item Symmetric: Not symmetric since (0,3) $\in T$, but (3,0) $\notin T$.
    \item Asymmetric: Since no element in $T$ is bidirectional and there are no elements that are self-loops, it is asymmetric. 
    \item Antisymmetric: Since the relation is asymmetric, it is antisymmetric.
    \item Transitive: Not transitive since (0,3), (3,2) $\in S$, but (0,2) $\notin S$.
    \item Equivalence: Not an equivalence relation since it is not reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
    \item Partial order: Not a partial order relation since it is not reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
\end{itemize}

\underline{Relation U}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflexive: Since (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) (3,3), (4,4) $\in U$, it is reflexive.
    \item Irreflexive: Not irreflexive since an element that is related to itself exists (i.e (0,0)).
    \item Symmetric: Since every pair in $U$ is bidirectional, it is symmetric.
    \item Asymmetric: Not asymmetric since (0,1), (1,0) $\in U$.
    \item Antisymmetric: Not antisymmetric since (0,1), (1,0) $\in U$, but 0 $\neq$ 1.
    \item Transitive: Since $\forall a,b,c \in A$: ($aUb \wedge bUc$) $\rightarrow$ $aUc$, it is transitive.
    \item Equivalence: Since the relation is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, it is an equivalence relation.
    \item Partial order: Not a partial order relation since it is not reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
\end{itemize}
