\section{Problem 4 (12 pts)}
\subsection{Description}

Consider list $\Lambda = \langle w, x, y, z \rangle$, deployed to implement a Queue Abstract Data Type.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let the head of $\Lambda$ correspond to the front position of the Queue. Implement operations \texttt{enqueue(el, $\Lambda$)} and \texttt{dequeue($\Lambda$)} using list construction operations. In both cases we can refer to $\Lambda'$ as the state of the list upon successful termination of one of its operations.

\item Let us now reverse the way we manipulate our data structure and let the head of $\Lambda$ correspond to the rear of the Queue.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What would be the result of $cons(el, \Lambda)$, and would it be a correct implementation for operation \texttt{enquue(el, $\Lambda$)}?
\item What would be the result of $list(el, \Lambda)$, and would it be a correct implementation for operation \texttt{enqueue(el, $\Lambda$)}?
\item What would be the result of $concat(list(el), \Lambda)$, and would it be a correct implementation for operation \texttt{enqueue(el, $\Lambda$)}?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
