\section{Problem 1: State (7 pts)}

\subsection{Description:}

The declaration of the state of the system is defined by

\begin{itemize}
    \item The set of phone numbers (call it \textit{numbers}) that are recorded in contacts
    \item A record of association between names and phone numbers, given by a correspondence
        (call it \textit{recorded}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide a diagram to visualize the state of the system.
    \item Provide a formal definition for numbers.
    \item Does \textit{recorded} have to be captured by a function? What requirements would a function
enforce? Explain in detail.
    \item What is the domain and the codomain of \textit{recorded}?
    \item What type of function should \textit{recorded} be (full or partial)? Explain in detail.
    \item Will \textit{recorded} be an injective, surjective, or bijective? Explain in detail.
    \item Provide a formal definition for \textit{recorded}.
