\section{Problem 1: State (7 pts)}

\subsection{Description:}

The declaration of the state of the system is defined by

\begin{itemize}
    \item The set of phone numbers (call it \textit{numbers}) that are recorded in contacts
    \item A record of association between names and phone numbers, given by a correspondence
        (call it \textit{recorded}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide a diagram to visualize the state of the system.
    \item Provide a formal definition for numbers.
    \item Does \textit{recorded} have to be captured by a function? What requirements would a function
enforce? Explain in detail.
    \item What is the domain and the codomain of \textit{recorded}?
    \item What type of function should \textit{recorded} be (full or partial)? Explain in detail.
    \item Will \textit{recorded} be an injective, surjective, or bijective? Explain in detail.
    \item Provide a formal definition for \textit{recorded}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Answer:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The following figure visualizes the state of the system:
        \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/Diagram.png}
        \caption{State of the System}
        \label{fig:Diagram}
        \end{figure}
    \item $numbers$ can be formally defined as: \\
    $\{ \forall x, y: numbers | (x \in numbers \wedge y \in numbers) \rightarrow x \neq y \}$
    \item
    \item
    \item
    \item
    \item
\end{enumerate}
